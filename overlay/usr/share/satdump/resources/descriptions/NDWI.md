# NDWI

NDVWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) is a simple enhancement used to monitor changes in water content of leaves using the difference of the two channels used by this enhancement (1.61 and 0.863 µm).

THIS ENHANCEMENT IS EXPERIMENTAL

### Appearance

Scale going from deep blue (high leaf water content) to light blue (low leaf water content)
Clouds and ambiguous areas appear gray.


### Intended usage

Vegetation analysis, agriculture, crop irrigation, pasture management, forests management.

### Limitations

Cloud dependent.
