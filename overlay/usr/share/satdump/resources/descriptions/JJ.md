# JJ

This enhancement, also called *Sea surface/cold cloud*, is used to highlight both sea surface temperatures, and cold
cloud tops associated with thunderstorms and other weather systems. Maximum enhancement is provided at the warm end (23 to 0C) to depict sea surface temperatures and low clouds. The presence of a freezing level break point is important for aviation
users interested in icing conditions. Multiple, steep, ramp enhancement ranges provide considerable detail within cold cloud tops such as thunderstorms.
