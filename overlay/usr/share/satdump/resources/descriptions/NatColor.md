# Natural color

Natural color is a visible-light enhancement typically used on the Metop and METEOR-M satellites.

It tries to reduce the cyan color caused by ice absorption on the *3a21* enhancement, by combining the 3.74 Âµm short-wave infrared band.

### Appearance

Land appears green (vegetated areas) or yellowish orange (deserts), while the sea appears blue.
Clouds appear white.
Fog appears whitish-gray.

### Intended usage

General purpose imagery in the daytime.

### Limitations

Cannot usually be used on NOAA POES satellites as they do not usually transmit channel 3a.
Hard to determine the cloud nature.
Cannot discriminate between cirrus clouds and fog.
