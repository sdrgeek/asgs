# NDVI

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is a simple enhancement that enables detection of living vegetation in a particular area.

The difference of the two channels used by this enhancement (0.62 and 0.863 Âµm) permits the detection of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) band, which is the radiation absorbed by the plants to perform chlorophyllian photosynthesys.

### Appearance

Water appears blue.
Land with living vegetation appears in progressively darker shades of yellow-green and then green.
Deserts appear yellow.
Clouds or ambiguous areas appear white.

### Intended usage

Vegetation analysis, deforestation and desertification monitoring.

### Limitations

Cloud dependent.
