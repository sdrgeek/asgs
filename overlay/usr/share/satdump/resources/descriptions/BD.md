# BD

This enhancement, also called *Hurricane enhancement*, uses a look-up table to highlight certain temperatures in the eye and eye wall of the storm that are known to be related to the intensity of the storm.

Dvorak (1984) developed a technique for measuring the intensity of these tropical cyclones by comparing the warmest spot within the eye and the warmest cloud top temperature within the cold cloud ring surrounding the eye. The greater that difference, the more intense the tropical cyclone.

This curve facilitates those estimating tropical cyclone intensity by highlighting the differences between the eye temperature and that of the cold cloud ring by performing severe contrast stretches in both warm and cold portions of the enhancement curve.
