This enhancement, also called *Cold climate MB* uses a look-up table to highlight specific cloud top temperatures in thunderstorm systems where there is the highest likelyhood of the strongest precipitations to be occurring. It is similar to the MB enhancement, but is modified for use over colder northern latitudes in winter.

### Appearance

Gray scale.
