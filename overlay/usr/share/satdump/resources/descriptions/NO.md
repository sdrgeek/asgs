This enhancement, also (improperly) called *Rain* or *Precipitation*, uses a look-up table to highlight certain temperatures in the cloud top that correspond to a higher likelyhood of precipitations.

It also greatly enhances the contrast in the land/sea regions with respect to the clouds, which are usually hard to see on pure infrared imagery.

### Appearance

Clouds with progressively higher likelyhood of precipitation, including areas that are already receiving precipitation, appear green, then yellow, then red, and finally black.

Land and sea appear in shades of brown (hot) to gray (cold).
