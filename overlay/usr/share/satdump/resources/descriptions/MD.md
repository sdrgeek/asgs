# MD

This enhancement, also called *Warm season MB* or *Warm season thunderstorm*, is a modification of the MB enhancement scheme. It is intended for warm season use, and provides improved enhancement within the gray "step wedges" that depict "warm top" convection. An additional improvement is better delineation of warm low clouds (30 °C to 7 °C). The middle cloud range is somewhat broader than with MB, and enhancement of details is minimised. 

Otherwise, it is the same as the MB enhancement.

### Appearance

Gray scale.
