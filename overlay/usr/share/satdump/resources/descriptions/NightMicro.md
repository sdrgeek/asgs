# Night Microphysics

The Night Microphysics enhancement makes use of various shades of colors and three spectral bands in the short wave and long wave infrared to enable night time cloud identification and analysis, including fog discrimination.

### Appearance

### Intended usage

Meteorology (In-depth cloud and fog analysis).

### Limitations

The large number of colors it can produce make its interpretation hard, especially for inexperienced users.
Can be contaminated by solar light, for example at the terminator.
Thin radiation fog is semi-transparent, which can alter pixel colors.
The color of cloud free regions varies depending on their temperature, surface type, and the column moisture.
Seasonal and diurnal variations.
Very cold clouds show yellow noise.
