# Cloud Underlay

This enhancement strips only the clouds from the satellite image, and applies them as a layer over a predefined map. This can help to differentiate some cloud types from land in single-band infrared imagery.

This can be used to provide daytime-like imagery even at night.

### Appearance

Clouds appear white.
Land and sea appear as specified by the map used (by default, a physical map).

### Intended usage

Aesthetical reasons, cloud analysis

### Limitations

Limited scientific value
