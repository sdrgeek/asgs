# Snow cover (transparent)

This enhancement uses the 89 GHz channel to detect and analyze snow cover, and the 157 GHz channel to remove unwanted features.

This enhancement is designed to be overlay on other data, such as a radiometer image or a map.

### Appearance

Areas with little or no snow cover are rendered transparent. Progressively more intense precipitation are shown in shades of green, then yellow and then red.

### Intended usage

Snow cover detection and analysis.

### Limitations

Icing clouds can be misdetected as snow cover.
Noise (e.g. due to bad signal during the reception) can be hard to distinguish from actual snow cover.
