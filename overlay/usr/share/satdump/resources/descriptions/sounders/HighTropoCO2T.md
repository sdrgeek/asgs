# High Troposphere CO2 Temperature

This enhancement uses the CO2 absorption wavelength at 13.99 Âµm to measure the temperature in the higher parts of the troposphere (CO2 is uniformly mixed in the atmosphere).
A color temperature scale enhancement is then used to enable easier analysis.

### Appearance

Low temperature shows as blue, as the temperature increases the color turns to yellow and red.

### Intended usage

Meteorology.

### Limitations

No specific limitation.
