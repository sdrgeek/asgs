# HIRS false color

This enhancement, also called 543 from the numbers of the channels used, selects channel 5 (high troposphere temperature), 4 (top troposphere temperature) and 3 (low stratosphere temperature) and outputs them as red, green and blue respectively.

Its main use is to verify that the filter wheel is in sync, as any jitter in the wheel or other instrument malfunction will result in recognizable patterns forming on this enhancement.

On IASI, this enhancement is provided for cross-checking with HIRS.

### Appearance

Towering cumulonimbus appear whitish-gray. The rest of the image appears in various colors, but regular patterns of extremely bright or dark pixels of either colors should not appear.

### Intended usage

Instrument functionality verification.

### Limitations

Limited scientific value.
