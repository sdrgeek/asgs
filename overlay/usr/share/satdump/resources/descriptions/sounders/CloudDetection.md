# Cloud Detection

This enhancement uses the visible 0.693 Âµm atmospheric window band to detect clouds in an optical way.

A color scale is used to help with easier analysis.

For all practical purposes, the *Cloud Only (N2O Sounding)* enhancement should be used.

### Appearance

Low or no cloud shows as blue, as the cloud thickness increases the color turns to yellow and red.

### Intended usage

Meteorology (cloud analysis).

### Limitations

It is not possible to determine the cloud top temperature.
Daytime only.
Low contrast.
Land features can be mistaken as low clouds.
