# Rainfall

This enhancement uses the difference between the 190 GHz and 183 GHz channels to detect rainfall.

### Appearance

Areas of no rain are rendered pure blue. Progressively more intense precipitation are shown in shades of green, then yellow and then red.

### Intended usage

Precipitation detection and analysis.

### Limitations

Precipitation does not necessarily reach the ground.
Noise (e.g. due to bad signal during the reception) can be hard to distinguish from precipitation.
