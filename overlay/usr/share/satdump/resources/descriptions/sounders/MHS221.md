# MHS 221

This enhancement uses a 157 GHz channel in the red and green outputs, and an 89 GHz channel for the blue part.

The 89 GHz channel is sensitive to precipitation and snow cover as well as moisture at or slightly above the surface level.
The 157 GHz channel is a pure atmospheric window.

### Appearance

Darker shades of blue indicate higher likelyhood of precipitation, higher moisture at the surface level or thicker snow cover. Yellow indicates the absence of such phenomena.
Sea usually appears darker yellow or black.

### Intended usage

All-weather meteorology.

### Limitations

Very ambiguous, especially in winter or higher latitudes.
