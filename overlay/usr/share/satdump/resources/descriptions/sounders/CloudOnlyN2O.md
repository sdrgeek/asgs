# Cloud only (N2O sounding)

This enhancement uses the nitrous oxide sounding channels 14 and 13 (4.40 and 4.46 Âµm respectively) to detect temperature drops caused by clouds. 

These channels are insensitive to the ground and therefore produce an excellent, cloud only product that is easier to interpret compared to the other cloud only HIRS product.

### Appearance

Clouds appear progressively more white as their thickness increases.
Background is blue.

### Intended usage

Meteorology (cloud analysis)

### Limitations

Difficult to determine the cloud top temperature.
