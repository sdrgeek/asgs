# Significant Thunderstorms (Transparent)

This enhancement uses the 157 and 183 GHz channels to detect towering cumulonimbus clouds and significant thunderstorm nuclei.

As all transparent enhancements, it is designed to be overlay on other data, such as a radiometer image or a map.

### Appearance

Areas with no thunderstorms nuclei are transparent. Areas with moderate certainty of thunderstorm nuclei are marked yellow. Area with good certainty of thunderstorm nuclei are marked red.

### Intended usage

Thunderstorm nuclei detection.

### Limitations

Experimental algorithm.
Noise (e.g. due to bad signal during the reception) can be hard to distinguish from nuclei.
