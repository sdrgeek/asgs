# MHS 421

This enhancement uses a 183 GHz channel on the red part, a 157 GHz channel in the green output, and an 89 GHz channel for the blue part.

Compared to MHS 221, it enables easier discrimination of different weather phenomena.

### Appearance

Water vapor clouds are rendered in shades of blue. Snow cover is pink or magenta. Land features are in shades of green, and sea is yellow or red.

### Intended usage

All-weather meteorology.

### Limitations

Snow cover detection can be altered by icing conditions in clouds.
Precipitation does not necessarily reach the ground.
Water vapor content in the lower atmosphere can create ambiguous shades of magenta.
