# HE

This enhancement, also called *Western US*,  is used principally by weather offices in the western United States. 
It provides good enhancement of a wide variety of cloud types, but is somewhat complex, and may be difficult to use at first. 

It enhances low and middle level clouds common along the Pacific Coast of North America in two separate gray shaderanges. The freezing level is easily determined, an advantage for aviation users concerned with icing. Step wedge regions display very cold infrared cloud top temperatures associated with thunderstorms and frontal systems in 5 degree increments down to -60 °C. Two additional "repeat gray" segments define cloud top temperatures colder than -60 °C.
