# Thermal Channel (uncalibrated)

Automatically selects the thermal infrared (10.8 µm) channel and equalizes it.

This enhancement is NOT calibrated in temperature.

On IASI, it makes use of the 11 µm high resolution imaging channel.

### Appearance

Colder temperatures appear white while warmer temperatures appear progressively darker shades of black.

### Intended usage

Qualitative temperature analysis

### Limitations

No emissivity compensation.
No calibration (qualitiative analysis only).
