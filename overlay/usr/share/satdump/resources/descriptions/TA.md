# TA

The TA curve is a combination of the CA curve (warm portion) and the HD curve (colder portion).

The linear part of the curve is to improve land/water/low cloud contrast.  The coldest part 
of the curve is in the same temperature ranges that are used for precipitation estimates and 
tropical storm classifications.
