# Sea surface temperatures

This enhancement uses a land mask to remove ground, two long wave infrared channels (10.8 and 12.4 Âµm) and an emissivity correction factor to provide a calibrated temperature of the sea surface.

### Appearance

Colder temperatures appear violet while warmer temperatures appear orange or red.

### Intended usage

Sea surface temperature measurements, sea water currents analysis

### Limitations

Cloud dependent.
