# HF

This enhancement, also called *New western US* is used principally by weather offices in the western United States and is essentially an updated version of the HE enhancement. 

It enhances low and middle level clouds common along the Pacific Coast of North America. Step wedge regions display very cold infrared cloud top temperatures associated with thunderstorms and frontal systems in 5 °C increments down to -60 °C. Two additional "repeat gray" segments define cloud top temperatures colder than -60 °C.
