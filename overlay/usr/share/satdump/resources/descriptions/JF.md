This enhancement, also called *simple sea surface/cold cloud*, is a hybrid enhancement scheme used to highlight both sea surface temperatures, and cold cloud tops  associated with thunderstorms and other weather systems. It is somewhat simpler to interpret than the later JJ enhancement. The coldest portion of the enhancement (less than -33 °C) is nearly identical to the general use MB enhancement. The maximum  enhancement is provided at the warm end (25 to 10 °C) to depict sea surface temperatures and warm low cloudsin tropical and sub-tropical areas.
