# Brightness Temperature at Channel 2

This is a composite based on the *JPSS-1 ATMS Level 1B Brightness Temperature V2 (SNDRJ1ATMSL1B)*[1].

Calibrated temperature values from channel 2 (31.4 GHz) are used.

### Appearance

The temperature range displayed starts at 140K (-133.15 °C) and ends at 300K (26.85 °C).

The lower the temperature is, the colder the color will be, and, the higher the temperature, the warmer the color will be.

Breakpoints occour for every 5K. In total the LUT is composed of 32 colors.

### Intended usage

Brightness temperature.

### Limitations

No specific limitations.
